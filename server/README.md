##Step 1: Install PostgreSQL
If you haven't already installed PostgreSQL, you can do so from the official PostgreSQL website: https://www.postgresql.org/download/.


#Step 2: Create a Database and Connect to PostgreSQL
After installing PostgreSQL, open a terminal or command prompt and execute the following commands to create the database and connect to PostgreSQL:

psql -U your_username
In the above command, replace "your_username" with the username you created during PostgreSQL installation.

You will be prompted for the user's password. Enter your password you also create during PostgreSQL installation.Code is not visible when entering. 

Then, you can create the database:
createdb mydatabase

In the above command, replace "mydatabase" with the desired name of the database."pernpeople" is suggested for the base name

After creating the database, you can proceed to Step 3.

#Step 3: Create a "People" Table
Next, you can create the "people" table:

Copy code
CREATE TABLE people (
    id UUID DEFAULT UUID_GENERATE_V4() PRIMARY KEY,
    firstname VARCHAR(255),
    lastname VARCHAR(255),
    dateofbirth DATE
);

These commands will create a new database and a "people" table within it. You can execute these SQL commands in a PostgreSQL client or using the psql command-line tool.
